# ADBWinstall
A simple program written in python for Windows machines to download
latest version of platform tools and add it in path.

## Usage

- clean up old installations if there are any (will add an option later to automatically perform this)
- Make sure you are connected to internet
- Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/rvsmooth/ADBWinstall/releases/latest/download/pyadbinstall.exe) and run it as an administrator
- wait for it to finish and enjoy

- If windows deletes this file as soon as you download it, turn off real-time protection,
run this program and then re-enable that.
